# odin-recipes
Hello to those that are reading this!

In this first project Iâ€™ll demonstrate my very basic html/git knowledge that I've learned so far through the Odin Project. 
I'll be creating a very basic web page where I'll be linking to a bunch of recipes through a main index page.
By the end of this project, I believe I should be able to create a readable and functional webpage that falls within the parameters of the assignment.

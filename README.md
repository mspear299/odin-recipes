# odin-recipes
This is a very basic html site with a main index page that links to three seperate recipe pages. I've tried to apply everything I've learned in the previous Odin lessons like making fonts bolded/italicized, inserting images, creating absolute/relative links, making ordered/unordered lists, and so on. 
 
All recipes used in the is project came from allrecipes.com
